==============================================
== Running the viewer on your local machine ==
==============================================

Run the following in a shell, to build the javascipt and html up
for constituent files, and then to grab real live data to test
with from the real groundcrew.us server and cache it locally.

% make
% make grab GCUN='<your groundcrew.us email>' GCPW='<your password>'

At this point you should be able to run the viewer locally in
firefox or safari or whatever:

% open BUILD/viewer.html     # or...
% firefox BUILD/viewer.html

If you change javascript, html or css files, you have to run
'make' to rebuild.

The only thing that doesn't work quite right in local mode are
the user images.  Sorry about that.  Also, only your home city
will have data loaded from the server.



=====================
== Troubleshooting ==
=====================

GOOGLE MAPS:  In order for google maps to work, you need to access 
the viewer from either a *.groundcrew.us domain, or a localhost url, 
or a file:/// url.  If you refer to your local machine in some other 
way it will not work.
