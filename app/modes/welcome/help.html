	<h3> What is POSX? </h3>

    In Groundcrew, "posx" stands for "positive experience". Players accumulate
    posx points whenever they are involved with someone else having a positive
    experience&mdash;for instance when they give someone an assignment that's
    appreciated, or participate in an assignment that makes a wish come true. Posx
    points cannot be "spent"--under normal conditions, a player's posx will only
    increase as they continue to play. This makes posx a kind of 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whuffie">reputation currency</a>, 
		similar to the seller point system on eBay. Groundcrew is a reputation economy or 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy">gift economy</a>.

    POSX gives players an incentive to be honest and to help each other out.
    Players with high posx enjoy certain advantages in the community of
    Groundcrew. First and foremost, any wishes/desires/challenges from high posx
    players are prioritized when presented to dispatchers to be made real.
    Secondly, more agents and physical resources become available to high posx
    players. When a new player is dispatching, they can only see a small subset of
    the players and objects available on the map. As players gain a track record
    of generating positive experience, they are allowed to see more and more,
    including more high value / high risk shared objects like donated automobiles,
    shared swimming pools, etc, which are not revealed to beginners.

<div id="about_squadm">
	<h3> What is 'squadm'? </h3>

    It's the number of people who've joined your squad. When people
    *really* like assignments you've given, either by reviewing your
    profile or by being an agent and really enjoying it, they may decide
    that they want to be available for anything you might do in the
    future and join your squad.  This is rarer than getting posx.
