== HOWTO create new apps ==
===========================

When you have coded some functionality within your app, you might want to test
it a bit. It might be quite tedious to click through all sorts of dialogs,
hence there is this nifty feature that allows you to go to an app directly.
Point your browser to:

  viewer.html#/<app>/<argument>{/<arguments>}

the arguments depend on the url_part_labels defined for the app. for example,

  viewer.html#/ideas/City__277/Landmark__p1435522

will take you directly to the dialog to choose an idea to be used for an
event in Montr√©al at the landmark 'Le Plateau'.

Note that depending on your app, supplying url_part_labels might not be enough
to have a sufficient state configured in the viewer.

However, the tags for landmarks (via Panoramio) are a wee bit volatile. So the
way to get a persistent landmark on your local machine is the following:

- on the live site, go edit the name of a landmark somewhere using the
  landmark editor
- note the landmark's tag / url in the console
- do a make grab locally to get the new updated landmark in your vstart.js
- refer to it at will in urls.
